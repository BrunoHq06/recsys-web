# Anime Recommendation System

The ideia behind this project was to use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) dataset to make a collaborative filltering recomendation system. To prevent cold start, the user has to pass five different animes and rate then from 1-10. 

### The app is currently deployed [here](https://share.streamlit.io/brunohq06/recsys-web/main/web_app.py)
